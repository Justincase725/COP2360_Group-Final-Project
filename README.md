# COP2360_Group-Final-Project
COP2360 Module 10 – Contractor & Subcontractor Final Project Overview

This project was developed as part of COP2360: C# Programming – Module 10 (Classes & Inheritance). It demonstrates how to design and implement C# classes using inheritance, constructors, accessors, mutators, and business logic. The goal is to help students understand how object-oriented programming can be applied to real-world contractor and subcontractor management scenarios.

Features

Create Contractor objects with name, contractor number, and start date

Create Subcontractor objects that inherit Contractor data

Add subcontractor-specific fields, including:

Shift (1 = Day, 2 = Night)

Hourly pay rate

Calculate pay with a 3% night-shift differential

Collect user input from the console to build multiple subcontractor records

Display subcontractor details and a final summary

Demonstrate class inheritance, method design, and object creation

How It Works

When the program starts, the user is prompted to enter contractor and subcontractor information.

The application creates a Subcontractor object using the collected input.

If the subcontractor works night shift, a 3% pay increase is automatically applied.

The program repeats until the user chooses to stop.

A summary list of all subcontractors entered is displayed at the end of execution.
